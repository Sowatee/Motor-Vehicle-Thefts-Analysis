# Identify where vehicles are likely to be stolen

Your third objective is to explore the population and density statistics in the regions table to identify where vehicles are getting stolen, and visualize the results using a scatter plot and map.

- [X] Find the number of vehicles that were stolen in each region
- [X] Combine the previous output with the population and density statistics for each region
- [X] Do the types of vehicles stolen in three most dense regions differ from the three least dense regions?
- [X] Create a scatter plot of population versus density, and change the size of the points based on the number of vehicles stolen in each region
- [X] Create a map of the regions and color the regions based on the number of stolen vehicles
